ADVANTAGES.
1.Open source
2.Allows applications build with different languages,OS and platforms to integrate with each other.
3.Location Transparency-Client applications doesnt need to know where the server appliation are located.
4.Reliable Communications-Both the client and thee server need not to be available at the same time.(due to the queues)
5.The size of the queueue is dynamic(variable sized queues)
6.Less time consumption-Due to the asynchronous communication,instead waiting till the server sends a response-client can carry con the next set of operations.
7.Reduced coupling-The information(such as location,protocol and availability) of the service can be changed easily withour effecting the client.
8.Easy coding.(ActiveMQ uses JAVA where others use Erlang)
